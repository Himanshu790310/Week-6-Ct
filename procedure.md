we have some lists and we wanna know some students of maths who performed well in math do they done simmilar in physics?
so that we wiil create a procedure to make list in ascending order
We have a list of 30 students and thier marksheet as well

procedure createMarklist(X.seq, x.Math)
Marklist = []
while( Table 1 has more rows){
    Marklist = Marklist ++ [X.seq, X.Math]
     }
  return(Marklist)

Procedure sortlist(L)
SL = []
flag = False
foreach y in L{
    if(not(flag)){
       if(y < x){
    SL = SL ++ [y]
  } else {
   if(x > y){
  SL = SL ++ [x]
  flag = True
   }
 }
 if(not(flag)){
 SL = SL ++ [x]
 }
flag = False
}
flag = False
